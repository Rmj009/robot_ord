# 2018/10/16 axis 2 position loading reliability test
## Beyond 10 sec is invaild
## Task : All axes horizonal to the ground and axis-2 for vertical motion from 0 to 90 degree
note that

# motion to motion per 10sec
* link2 -> -90 degree (at 5sec
* link4 -> 90 degree (at 5sec
* link1 -> -30 degree (at 10sec
* link2 -90 to 0 motion steadily

bug -> last motion is too slow
try no fan
Almost 3hrs trial
due to collision/unmatch i force to push by git push -f
