# 2018/10/15 axis 1 position loading reliability test
# Beyond 10 sec is invaild
## Task : All axes horizonal to the ground and axis-1 for parallel motion from -30 to 30 degree

note that 
<<<<<<< HEAD
* motion to motion per 10sec
* link2 -> -90 degree (at 10sec
* link4 -> 90 degree (at 10sec
* link1 -> -30 degree (at 20sec
=======
* link2 -> -90 degree (at 5sec
* link4 -> 90 degree (at 5sec
* link1 -> -30 degree (at 10sec
* link1 -30 to 30 motion steadily
>>>>>>> fab0b362bdd619e2aa11595095785af4443789b6
* bug -> 19% got stuck because of careless
* try no fan
* Almost 3hrs trial
